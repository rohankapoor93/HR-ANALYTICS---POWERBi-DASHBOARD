# HR-ANALYTICS---POWERBi-DASHBOARD
The objective of the "My HR Analytics - PowerBI Dashboard" project is to provide a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of employee attrition within the organization. By leveraging the powerful visualization capabilities of PowerBI, the dashboard aims to offer insights into the attrition rate and its various influencing factors. Specifically, the project will analyze attrition by employees to identify patterns and trends, attrition by age to understand demographic impacts, attrition by tenure to see how length of service affects turnover, attrition by education to explore the relationship between educational qualifications and retention, attrition by job profile to pinpoint roles with higher turnover rates, and attrition by salary slab to investigate the correlation between compensation levels and employee departures. The ultimate goal is to equip HR professionals and organizational leaders with actionable insights to inform strategic decisions aimed at reducing attrition and improving employee retention.
